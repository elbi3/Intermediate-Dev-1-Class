//Assignment: Replace `var` with `const` or `let` & explain

let fullName = "John Doe";
fullName = "Jane Doe";
console.log(fullName);
//Since we want to be able to declare and then reassign "fullName", we use `let`. If `const` is used, we get error "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."

let age = 30;
if (age > 18) {
    let adult = true;
    console.log(adult);
}
//Using either `let` or `const` will not break this code, however extending the control flow statement could generate potential issues. In order to be able to reuse "adult", and to assign it the boolean `false`, we need to declare "adult" with `let`. While we *could* use `const` to declare "age", it does not make much sense since we are *checking* the age value- this variable is likely to change as well. Better to use `let`. It's pretty situational.

const loopArray = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    loopArray.push(i);
}
console.log(loopArray);
//We are mutating this array, however its declaration assignment is not changing, so use `const`. Within the loop header of the for loop control statement, use `let` since we will be reassigning the index number on every loop.

let MAXIMUM = 100;
MAXIMUM = 200;
let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
colors = ["Yellow", "Pink", "Purple"];
console.log(colors);
//Use `let` when reassigning declared variables. Use of `const` will prevent this reassignment.
