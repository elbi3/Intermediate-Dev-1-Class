# Coursework Repository

This repository contains assignments for my Node.js web development course.

Most folders represent small, focused exercises completed as part of coursework.
For full-scale, production-style projects, see my pinned repositories:

- 🚀 Astro Chat App
- 🛰️ Express NASA Rover API
- 🌐 Personal Website (Astro)

This repo is primarily for academic completeness.
